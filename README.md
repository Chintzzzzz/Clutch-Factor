# Measuring Clutch: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning of High-Pressure Performance at FC Barcelona (2018–2021)

## Dissertation<br>
  Clutch performance—the ability to deliver decisive contributions under high-pressure circumstances—remains one of the most sought-after yet elusive qualities in elite football. Despite its significance, existing research offers limited consensus on how to objectively define, quantify, and compare clutch performances across players and contexts. This thesis addresses this gap by developing and validating a novel, data-driven framework for measuring clutch performance in football, leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.<br>
  Utilizing publicly available event-level data from the StatsBombR package, the study focuses on La Liga matches spanning the 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 seasons. A composite clutch factor metric is constructed, integrating a range of performance indicators—including goals, assists, expected goals (xG), and context-sensitive event flags—each weighted according to their situational importance. The metric is specifically designed to capture contributions made in the final stages of matches, where pressure and match outcome stakes are highest. The weighting scheme is informed by both domain expertise and empirical validation, ensuring that the composite score reflects the nuanced realities of clutch situations.<br>
To evaluate and refine the clutch factor, the study employs a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Ridge regression is used to address multicollinearity among predictors and to empirically validate the weighting of individual components, with models trained and tested across different seasons to assess generalizability. The results demonstrate that the composite metric reliably predicts clutch outcomes and that the most decisive actions—such as winning goals or assists when losing—carry the greatest weight in high-pressure contexts. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to cluster players based on their performance profiles, revealing distinct archetypes and highlighting players who consistently excel in clutch moments.<br>
The findings underscore the value of integrating contextual and situational variables into performance evaluation, moving beyond traditional metrics that may overlook the psychological and tactical dimensions of clutch play. The proposed framework not only advances the academic understanding of clutch performance but also offers practical tools for coaches, analysts, and decision-makers seeking to identify and nurture clutch talent within their squads.<br>
In conclusion, this thesis bridges methodological rigor with real-world applicability, providing a replicable blueprint for the objective assessment of clutch performance in football. The approach demonstrates how modern data science can illuminate the complexities of high-stakes athletic performance, laying the groundwork for future research and practical innovation in sports analytics.
